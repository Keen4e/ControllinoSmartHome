# ControllinoSmartHome

This is the initial upload of my Controllino programming to implement my smarthome. 

I use 2 controllinos - hence there are 2 files. They contain the same logic with different configurations. 

There is still a lot of quick and dirty in it - but so far it works ;) Cleanup is planned once time permits
